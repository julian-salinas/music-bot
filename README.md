# Music bot created for friends
##After groovy and rythm got banned by youtube the study server with my friends ran out of a bot that plays music so I created this bot to solve that :)

#

## In addition to the `discord.py` library, this bot uses the youtube downloader library `youtube_dl` accompanied by the FFMPEG tool, and allows users to play music on a voice channel, create a playlist, pause and resume the music as much as they want.

## Add the bot to your server [here](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=888305709639405579&permissions=0&scope=bot)
