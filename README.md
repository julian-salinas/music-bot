# your friendly neighbor grubi

## Why?! :anguished:
After groovy and rythm got banned by youtube the study server with my friends ran out of a bot that plays music so we created this bot to solve that :)

## How?! :confused:
In addition to the `discord.py` library, this bot uses the youtube downloader library `youtube_dl` accompanied by the FFMPEG tool, and allows users to play music on a voice channel, create a playlist, pause and resume the music as much as they want.

## How to setup the bot in your NASA PC :smirk:
1. Create a `.env` file and set the discord token like this:

```bash
TOKEN=<you-discord-token>
```

2. Run the docker container

```bash
$ docker-compose up
```

# Enjoy!
